## Introduction

This repository contains a collection of C# programs demonstrating fundamental OOP principles, including:

- **Classes and Objects**
- **Inheritance and Interface Implementation**
- **Encapsulation**
- **Polymorphism (Method Overloading/Overriding)**
- **Abstract Classes**

These examples will help solidify your understanding of how to structure and design OOP solutions in C#.

## Features

- **Simple and Clear Implementation:** Each example focuses on explaining core OOP concepts in a clear and concise manner.
- **Modular Design:** Code is organized into different files, making it easy to understand and expand upon.
- **Use of Interfaces and Abstract Classes:** Various examples implement abstract classes and interfaces to demonstrate inheritance and polymorphism.
